## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report:
1. Check the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported
2. Collect information about the bug:
   - Node.js version (`node --version`)
   - Operating system
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages and stack traces

Create a bug report with:
- Clear, descriptive title
- Detailed description

- Screenshots (if relevant)

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:
1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Explain the use case clearly
3. Describe the desired behavior
4. Consider implementation complexity
5. Discuss alternatives you've considered

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Run tests** to ensure everything passes
6. **Commit with clear messages** following our commit conventions
7. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

**Contributor License Agreement.** First-time external contributors will be prompted by the CLA Assistant bot to sign Engram's CLA on their PR — see [`CLA.md`](CLA.md) for the agreement text and signing instructions. It's a one-time step per GitHub account (subsequent PRs from the same account skip the prompt). The maintainer and bots like Dependabot are exempt.

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js

- Use ESM modules (`import/export`)
- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Handle errors appropriately
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous code

### Example:

```javascript
/**
 * Recall memories using hybrid search
 * @param {Database} db - SQLite database instance
 * @param {string} query - Search query
 * @param {Object} options - Search options
 * @returns {Promise<Object[]>} Array of relevant memories
 */
export async function recallMemories(db, query, options = {}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React/Frontend

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure responsive design
- Handle loading and error states

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

```javascript
describe('recallMemories', () => {
  it('should return relevant memories ranked by score', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should fall back to FTS when embeddings fail', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(recall): add namespace filtering to search

fix(embed): handle model download failures gracefully

docs(api): update REST API endpoint documentation

test(store): add tests for memory CRUD operations
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests once
npm run test:run

# Run specific test file
npx vitest test/memory/recall.test.js

# Run tests with coverage
npx vitest --coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `test/` directory
- Mirror the source structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Clean up resources in `afterEach`

```javascript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'vitest';

describe('Memory Store', () => {
  let db;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
    db = initDatabase(':memory:');
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
    db.close();
  });

  it('should create a memory with all fields', () => {
    const memory = createMemory(db, {
      content: 'Test content',
      category: 'fact'
    });

    expect(memory).toBeDefined();
    expect(memory.content).toBe('Test content');
  });
});
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Include parameter types and return types
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Document any non-obvious behavior

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples to the examples/ directory
- Update API documentation in docs/api.md
- Keep documentation clear and concise

## Versioning

Engram ships in two parallel artifacts: the npm package (`@hbarefoot/engram`, root `package.json`) and the desktop app (`desktop/package.json`). **Bump them together** — no asymmetric releases. The `dashboard/package.json` version is decoupled because the dashboard is bundled into both artifacts at build time, not separately consumed.

Release checklist for any version bump:

1. Update `package.json` and `desktop/package.json` to the same version.
2. Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` from the repo root.
3. Build the dashboard (`npm run build`) and confirm it's included in the npm tarball (`npm publish --dry-run`).
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new section for the version.
5. Commit, tag, push.
6. **Choose ONE publish path; do not double up:**
   - **(a) GitHub Release (recommended)** — Create a release on github.com. The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` workflow fires on the `release: published` event, runs CI, then publishes to npm with provenance. Hands-off.
   - **(b) Manual `npm publish`** — Run from a clean main checkout. Works the same but skips the visible Release artifact on GitHub.
   - If you do both, the second one races and fails with `You cannot publish over the previously published versions`. Happened on v1.5.3; expected and harmless, but worth knowing.
7. **Rebuild + redistribute the desktop app** if user-visible changes ship to the Tauri side. From the repo root:
   ```bash
   npm run desktop:build
   # produces desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/{macos,dmg}/
   # → upload .dmg (or zipped .app) as a GitHub Release asset
   ```
   The desktop installer is updated independently of npm; users with the .app need to download the new build to get post-bump fixes.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README and docs reflect your changes
2. **Add Tests**: New features must include tests
3. **Run Tests**: Verify all tests pass (`npm test`)
4. **Run Linter**: Check code style (`npm run lint`)
5. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add entry for your changes (if applicable)
6. **Describe Changes**: Write a clear PR description
7. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues
